# rebol-server

This repository contains bash scripts for creating a small Android .APK
package, that bundles an ARM-based Rebol interpreter ["Ren-C branch"][1]) with
a very tiny web server (implemented in Rebol).

Then it also includes a *second* Rebol interpreter, which is compiled to
[WebAssembly][2]...plus a cache of a web-based interactive console called
[Replpad-JS][3].

Rebol interpreters pride themselves on being small--so it's not a big deal to
have two of them in the package.  But...why, especially considering that you
can simply run ReplPad-JS from the network using the phone's native browser?

Because:

* The web console can be used offline.  Also, there is a kind of an "app store"
  concept--where GitHub repositories containing other interesting Rebol code
  can be downloaded and cached locally as well.

* The Android-native Rebol that is doing the local serving can act as a
  backchannel for capabilities that an ordinary website couldn't do.  Examples
  would be reading or writing files from the phone's internal storage, or
  fetching URLs that are not CORS-enabled.

*(Note: Since such backchannels can ultimately represent security risks, use
good judgment--as you would with any programming tool--when it comes to running
code from untrusted sources!!!)*


## Building the .APK

The bash scripts are designed to be able to run even on something like
[Termux][4], so you can run them and build the .APK on the phone itself!  The
scripts just pull down the latest executable from [Ren-C's Travis][5], so
there's no need to do any C compilation of Rebol itself on the phone (although
you certainly can!).

So really the main thing to do is make sure you have the right Android packing
tools installed.  You'll need to `apt install` the following:

* `zip`
* `dx`
* `apksigner`
* `zipalign`
* `javac` *or* `ecj`

If all those are in place, you can run `bash build.bash` and it should
"just work".  If not, please raise an issue:

## Future Directions

It would be nice if the bash scripts were ported to Rebol. :-)  It would also
be good if the packaging process could be Rebol-based, without needing to
depend on Java or other code.  (So having something like a `%jarsigner.reb`.)

Right now, the Android build of Rebol is really just a typical POSIX target.
So the number of "superpowers" it is able to grant to the web app are pretty
much limited to local file access--as well as more generalized network access
than is available to the average website.

However...it would be possible to create "extensions" that would use APIs from
the [Android NDK][8].  That would permit the Rebol webserver to do things like
take pictures, or read the GPS, or whatever.

One area that is **not** likely to be of much interest (to the core Rebol/Ren-C
developers) is trying to work with native Android GUI widgets.  That's because
the aim of this project is largely to embrace the trend toward browser-based
development, and "Progressive Web Apps":

...but the hope is to try doing so with a WebAssembly-based Rebol playing a big
role in that picture.
